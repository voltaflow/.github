# Repository Organization 🚀

Welcome to our GitHub organization! Here you will find a variety of repositories that cover different projects and applications. We strive to maintain an organized structure to facilitate navigation and management of our repositories. Let's take a look at how we organize our repositories using two approaches: Domain-driven organization and Multirepo. 📂

## Domain-driven Organization 🌐

In our organization, we group repositories by domain, representing different functional areas of our applications. Each repository focuses on a specific aspect and contains all the code and resources related to that particular domain. Here are the main domains and how we name our repositories:

1. **Infrastructure**: Repository: `domain-infrastructure` 🏢

2. **Frontend**: Repository: `domain-frontend` 🎨

3. **Backend**: Repository: `domain-backend` ⚙️

4. **Authentication**: Repository: `domain-authentication` 🔒

5. **API**: Repository: `domain-api` 🌐

6. **Database**: Repository: `domain-database` 🗄️

We use the `domain-` prefix followed by the lowercase domain name to clearly reflect the purpose and content of each repository.

## Multirepo 📦

In addition to the domain-driven approach, we also use the Multirepo approach for specific projects. With this approach, we maintain different projects in separate repositories to allow greater independence and flexibility. Here are some of our Multirepo repositories and how we name them:

1. **Project A**: Repository: `project-a` 🚀

2. **Project B**: Repository: `project-b` 🎉

3. **Project C**: Repository: `project-c` 🌟

For Multirepo projects, we use descriptive and concise names that reflect the name of the project itself.

## Naming Conventions 📝

To keep things consistent across our organization, we follow these naming conventions:

1. We use lowercase letters and hyphens to separate words in repository names.

2. We aim for descriptive and concise repository names that clearly reflect the purpose and content of the project.

3. If there are multiple related projects or applications within a domain, we use additional names or prefixes to differentiate them.

Please note that these conventions are our general guidelines and may vary based on the needs and preferences of your organization. The key is to maintain a fun, friendly, and easily understandable structure that encourages collaboration and repository management.

Thank you for being a part of our organization! We hope you find our repositories helpful and enjoy collaborating with us. ✨🤝
